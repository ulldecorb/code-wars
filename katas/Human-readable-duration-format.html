            Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

            The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
            
            It is much easier to understand with an example:

            <var>
                * For seconds = 62, your function should return 
                    "1 minute and 2 seconds"
                * For seconds = 3662, your function should return
                    "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
            </var>
        
            <h4>For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.</h4>

            Note that spaces are important.

            <h3>Detailed rules</h3>
            The resulting expression is made of components like 4 seconds, 1 year, etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.

            The components are separated by a comma and a space (", "). Except the last component, which is separated by " and ", just like it would be written in English.

            A more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, 1 second and 1 year is not correct, but 1 year and 1 second is.

            Different components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in 5 seconds and 1 second.

            A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence, 1 minute and 0 seconds is not valid, but it should be just 1 minute.

            A unit of time must be used "as much as possible". It means that the function should not return 61 seconds, but 1 minute and 1 second instead. Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.
